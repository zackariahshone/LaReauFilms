        Thank you for stopping by to learn a little more about LaReau Films.
    </p>
        <p>
        My name is Jared LaReau. I am a filmmaker, writer and producer. I grew up in the Ozark mountains in Northwest Arkansas. As you can imagine, Arkansas is not known for its burgeoning television and motion picture industry. But I always found a way to get my hands on whatever camera I could. Whether it was the instant camera that my parents would buy for special occasions or my first cell phone that had a camera, I was immediately fascinated with capturing images. The magic was not lost on me. I was hooked. After graduating from high school, I studied at the University Of Central Arkansas in their Digital Filmmaking school. While I certainly found a community of filmmakers in central Arkansas, I realized that if I wanted to make a living behind the camera, I would have to venture beyond the borders of Arkansas.
        </p>
        <p>
        So I cut my teeth by working at several ad agencies over the years. I learned from a lot of clients, asked questions, studied how other directors and production companies achieved such great results.

        And that is how LaReau Films was born. Through a combination of passion, obsession and years of hard work, LaReau Films has become a premiere video production company that offers a full service solution for all marketing and advertising needs. I have built many partnerships with the best and brightest in the New Orleans video production world. We are a team of creators, technical wizards and passionate storytellers. We study your business.
